{"name":"Tatsu.js","body":"# Game development for the web\r\nTatsu is a game engine, using the latest in web technologies to provide a simple programming model for game development. This project is very much still a work in progress. Stay tuned to this site for details.\r\n\r\n# Goal\r\nThis project started out as a way to learn how to write WebGL code, and as a way to write reusable components for demos and games. I hope to refine the project to make it a full-fledged game toolkit for the web.\r\n\r\n# Development\r\nCurrently, this project is in its infancy. I would love to hear your feedback and suggestions on the direction of Tatsu so far.\r\n\r\nThe first milestone for this project is to build something useable for the 10th anniversary of the [Ludem Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/) online game jam.\r\n\r\n# License\r\n[MIT License](https://github.com/mattrudder/Tatsu/blob/master/LICENSE-MIT)\r\n\r\n# Credits\r\n* [jQuery](http://jquery.com) - Currently using jQuery for DOM manipulation in demo code, and some remote file fetching.\r\n* [AltDevBlogADay](http://altdevblogaday.com) - This site has been a great resource for me regarding game development in general. Namely, [Mike Acton's introductory post on WebGL](http://altdevblogaday.com/2011/04/18/mike_acton-pokes-around-webgl-and-jquery/) was a huge help in understanding the basics of the technology.\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\n[Matt Rudder](http://mattrudder.com)","tagline":"Javascript-powered Game Engine for HTML5 Browsers","google":"UA-30526367-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
